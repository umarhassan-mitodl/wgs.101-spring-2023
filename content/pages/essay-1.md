## Assignment

- By closely analyzing two “first wave” texts (list below), identify and discuss the key rhetorical strategies used by such activists as Angelina Grimke, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Anna Julia Cooper, Frederick Douglass, Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell, and/or Susan B. Anthony to argue for gender equality. What approaches did they use in their writing or speeches to try to convince the people they were addressing? Who was/were their intended audience(s)? How did their use of language and types of argument aim to appeal to this audience(s)? Explain what each writer or speaker was trying to achieve and how their arguments aimed to help them accomplish their goals. 
- Readings to choose from:   
    - Angelina Grimke—“Human Rights Not Founded on Sex” (1837)   
    - Elizabeth Cady Stanton— “Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions” (1848); “Our Costume” (1851); “The Solitude of Self” (1892)   
    - Sojourner Truth—“Ain’t I a Woman?” (1851)   
    - Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell—“Marriage Agreement” (1855)   
    - Susan B. Anthony—“Speech after Being Convicted for Voting…” (1872)   
    - Frederick Douglass—“Why I Became a Woman’s Rights Man” (1881)   
    - Anna Julia Cooper—“Woman’s Cause is One and Universal” (1893)         
         
- You are very strongly encouraged to weave in references to class lectures, films, and readings (e.g., Boydston, Davis) to set the historical context for your close reading of the texts.
- You are also encouraged to integrate images into your essay from the “Online Museum” resources or other online sources.
