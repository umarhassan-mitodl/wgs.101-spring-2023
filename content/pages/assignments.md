## Three Major Writing Assignments

Each student will be responsible for submitting three major writing assignments during the semester. Each essay should be typed, double-spaced, and in Times New Roman 12-point font with one-inch margins; one page equals 250 words.

Major assignment prompts will be distributed at least two weeks prior to due dates. Each essay should demonstrate understanding of key concepts in the course by framing a clear argument in response to the question and supporting that argument with specific examples and quotations from relevant course readings. The {{% resource_link "74bf1a53-382d-4208-b1f0-7e829fd3c37d" "**first essay**" %}}, a comparative rhetorical analysis of primary historical texts, should be 5–6 pages (1250–1500 words) in the first version and 6–7 pages (1500–1750 words) in revision.

The next two major assignments will be 7–8 pages (1750–2000 words) each. The **second essay** offers the choice of a comparative analysis of classic literary and political texts or a case study of an individual analyzed within the framework of gender socialization literature. The **third major assignment** asks students to write an informational/educational narrative for a museum exhibit on historical and contemporary dimensions of gender, work, and family, drawing explicitly on secondary sources; the print text is supplemented by an exhibit of visual sources such as photographs, charts, graphs, maps, art work, film clips, etc.

## Current Event Analysis: Oral Presentation

Each student will give one {{% resource_link "8fddb88c-b5eb-4917-a324-a4f1c34bdd2f" "oral presentation" %}}, an analysis of a current event related to class readings and lectures/discussions of a particular week. Students will work in pairs to research and present an interpretation of a current event news article of their choice pertaining to the week’s topic. Your task is to make connections between concepts presented in an assigned reading or readings and lectures/films and a contemporary example in the news. This assignment requires close reading of the news item you choose, presenting your analysis in a coherent way to the class, along with several follow-up discussion questions. Students should plan to consult the instructor as they choose current events topics to research. Oral presentations should be about 15 minutes. A typed presentation plan or outline is due over email **a week before** the presentation. A short write-up of the presentation (and joint evaluation), accompanied by any visuals (e.g., PowerPoint, Google, or Prezi slides), will be due over email **a week after** the presentation; each student pair will also receive a joint letter grade and written evaluation of their oral presentation. Students are encouraged to read a major newspaper regularly to increase their awareness of media representations of contemporary gender issues.

## Reflection Assignment: Women’s and Gender Studies Event

 Students are asked to attend one women's and gender studies (WGS)-related event (lecture, film, reading) or watch a WGS-related film during the term and to write a short reflection (250–500 words or 1 1/2–2 pg.) on this event and its relationship to course content. 

## Writing Objectives

 Throughout the semester, I will encourage student writers to do the following

- Address an intelligent, public audience in a graceful style, providing key information necessary to understand an argument
- Develop ideas in an interesting, original, and coherent manner
- Formulate an organizing idea, thesis, or mapping statement
- Support arguments with appropriate evidence and use and cite sources thoughtfully and correctly
- Employ clear, concise language that uses the conventions of English grammar, punctuation, word usage, and source citation
- Structure arguments carefully with clear introductions, transitions, middles, and conclusions
